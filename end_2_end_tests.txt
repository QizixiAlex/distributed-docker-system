TestCase1(basic workflow):
    environment:
        localhost
    steps:
        start master, agent, client
        submit job(barcode_generator) from client to master
        list jobs from client
        stream output to file
    result:
        success

TestCase2(job status fail when agent down and no replacement agent):
    environment:
        localhost
    steps:
        start master, agent, client
        submit job(loop_forever) from client to master
        list job: status running
        force quit the only agent
        wait
        list job: status failed
    result:
        success
